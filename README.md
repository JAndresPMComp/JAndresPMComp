### Hi there, I'm José Andrés Pérez Mendoza 👋

**PhD Student @ IQUIR-UNR. Focus: Genetic Algorithms, DFT Calculations, Reactor Modeling & Applied Statistics. Python/R.**

I am a Chemical Engineer and Chemist dedicated to developing computational tools to solve complex challenges in science and engineering.

I have worked on **bioprocess simulation** and reactor modeling. Currently, my work is focused on combining the rigor of theoretical chemistry (DFT) with the efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
